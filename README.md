# UI Dev Technical Test - Dishwasher App

## Brief

Your task is to create a website that will allow customers to see the range of dishwashers John Lewis sells. This app will be a simple to use and will make use of existing John Lewis APIs.

We have started the project, but we'd like you to finish it off to a production-ready standard. Bits of it may be broken.


## Getting Started

- `Fork this repo` into your own GitLab namespace (you will need a GitLab account).
- Install the NPM dependencies using `npm i`. (You will need to have already installed Node.js using version `14.x`.)
- Run the development server with `npm run dev`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
